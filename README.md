# Simple-Operating-System
A basic operating system project that I hope to grow and modify as well as expand features.

**Notes
a) based on code from a group project along with classmates John Holstein, Josh Mosley and Abdullah Alnaibari.
b) builds off a source code provided by my instructor for the project base, Ms Camille Hayhurst @WVU Lane department of computer science and electrical engineering
